Right before I went to a concert with my last boyfriend he told me that although he told me he was going to take me to the concert, he didn't want to see me anymore. After that we stayed overnight and I said ""well, when he leaves me I will be ruined for awhile, but for now we're together."" I woke up in his arms and it was the happiest moment of my life.
