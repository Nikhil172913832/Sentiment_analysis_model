In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost 5 marks.""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not show my discontentment and carried on doing my work.
