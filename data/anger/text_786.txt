Last semester when I dated a girl whom I've known for almost a year. However one night she said she wanted us to be ""just friends"". I confided this to a friend Jim I was really suffering. A month or two later he broke up with his old girlfriend and they started going out regularly. I have no girlfriend nor have I had a romantic relationship of any significance. I feel some anger but we are friends again.
