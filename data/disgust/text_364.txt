I am disgusted with my sister's husband. On an early Sunday morning after having knocked at my door, he suddenly rushed in and finching me still in bed he began quarrelling about something. I could not understand. I heard his last words: ""Don't stare at me so because I'll beat you in your bed"" I got up terrified and a thrashing followed.
