This is an incident that many of us witness in our everyday life in a city like Bombay.  One day I was travelling by bus, three men dragged two fellows out of the bus.  Once outside they were beaten into pulp.  These two fellows, who got beaten, were pick-pockets and they were being beaten by all and sundry.  I thought to myself -""what is life?"".  It is one hell of a place where everyone is after someone else.  One waits to cut the throat of the other one just for a living, (money).  When I think about such things - the purpose of life, etc, I feel very disgusted and dejected.
