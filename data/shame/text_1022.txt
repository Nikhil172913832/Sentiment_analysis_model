One day, when I was sitting on the bus, there was an old woman standing beside me.  I was very tired and sleepy and did not think of giving her my seat.  A 50 year old woman who was sitting beside me got up and gave her seat to the old woman and said,  "" Old woman, please take my seat, the youngstters these days are not used to giving their seats to others.""  When I heard these words I was very ashamed of myself and wanted to get off the bus at once.
