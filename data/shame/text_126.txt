At school I was talking to a classmate about mathematics.  I had grown weary of it and said : ""I would like to throw the book on the arse of Kuikka"".  My classmate said : ""Now, he is sitting there and waiting for the book"" (Kuikka was one of the most quiet boys of the class).  I was ashamed of myself.
