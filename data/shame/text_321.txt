I was working in I. when a friend of mine borrowed his car so I could get bach there, I had to come to S.Paulo and his car was here. He said :""When you get the car tell my mother that you are only taking the car bacause I asked, for she doesn't like me to borrow it"". Next day he borrowed me it again for I had to come back again. When I was coming back I crashed the car quite a lot. One of the first person I met at the accident was his mother, that said to me ""You weren't to take the car only yesterday ?"" (before I saw her I was already ashamed).
