When I was in a bus on my way to the examination centre, a man    sitting opposite me kept looking at me continously.  I did not know  what was wrong.  When I reached the  centre I started strolling around  as I still had a little time.  Suddenly a man came and whispered ""You  have forgotten to zip up your trousers.""  I was at a loss to say anything  and I felt very embarrassed.  When I thought of the bus incident I felt  even more ashamed.
