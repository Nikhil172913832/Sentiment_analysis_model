A friend of mine has not very much money. Therefore, once I stayed with him and his girlfriend, I bought some meat, but nobody wanted to go and prepare it for dinner. My friend said ""I thought you wanted to invite us for dinner"". ""Of course"", I said, but I thought by myself that it must have been enough that I had bought it.
