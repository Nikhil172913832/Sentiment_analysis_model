When I was in the fifth class the rating was done in our mark-books. I hadn't been examined yet but I had heard from my classmates about the scolding they had got at home. My first mark was in geography - good 4. I judged I had known for more than that and I put down ""very good"" for fear of being scolded. Naturally my parents guessed all about it. They rebuked me for what I had done.
