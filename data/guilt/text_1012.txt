That evening when I opened the songbook while I was singing the song ""Those were the days"" that guilt feeling became stronger.  The lyrics described well - I was really wrong.  The wish that I had made was really bad. If she were with me I would really be happy and we would play happily together like the days in secondary school and she would not be disappointed and gloomy because of me.
